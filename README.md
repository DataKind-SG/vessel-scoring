# About

This repository contains fishing scoring heuristics and evaluation of their effectiveness,
as well as development of supervised-ML scoring algorithms.

It also contains some tools to deal with the data formats of some of our partners:

* Kristinas CSV-based format
* Alex' and Chris' fishing-hour sidecar format

Training data for this project is too big to store in this repository. It will be licensed separately. If you have been given acces, the datacan be found here:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7rRlQvqnpGIZVpSSFJRakhMcFk&usp=sharing

Note: You do not need the training data to use the predition models as the trained model parameters are stored in the repository.
