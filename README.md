# About

This repository contains fishing scoring heuristics and evaluation of their effectiveness,
as well as development of supervised-ML scoring algorithms.

It also contains some tools to deal with the data formats of some of our partners:

* Kristinas CSV-based format
* Alex' and Chris' fishing-hour sidecar format
